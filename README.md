# PyRate

PyRate is a Python package for sports ratings.  It is intended to
provide a simple interface for testing and evaluating rating systems
such as least-squares rating.  It is capable of reading in team and
game data from basic CSV file formats and storing resulting rating
data to a database.  It also includes a Flask module that creates a
website using data from the database.
